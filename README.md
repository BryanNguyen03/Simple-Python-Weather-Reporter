## Weather Report

A very simple Python program developed to learn how to use Python Requests that allows users to access the weather for a certain city using an API from openweathermap.

Note: You will need to insert your own API Key for the program to work
Instructions on how to get a key can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/appid
